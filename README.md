# Keylogger
keyloggers (Non-malicious ) are those that are used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employee activity in the workplace, parental control, or forensic investigations. In these cases, the user of the keylogger must obtain consent from the people being monitored, and use the tool in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.
A keylogger is a type of software or hardware tool that records every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device, including passwords, usernames, emails, chat messages, and other sensitive information. Keyloggers are often used by hackers or malicious actors to steal personal or confidential information from unsuspecting users.
For example, a company might use keyloggers to monitor the activity of its employees to ensure they are using company resources appropriately and not engaging in any illegal or unauthorized activities. Similarly, parents might use keyloggers to monitor their children's internet activity to protect them from online threats or inappropriate content.
Non-malicious keyloggers can also be used by law enforcement or forensic investigators to collect evidence in criminal investigations. In such cases, the use of keyloggers is typically authorized by a court order, and must be carried out in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.

Overall, the use of non-malicious keyloggers can be justified in certain situations, but it's important to obtain consent and use the tool in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.

“This Python script i a keylogger that logs every key pressed by the user while the program
is running. The script uses the “keyboard” module to detect key presses and the  datetine™

module to timestamp each key press event.

“The script starts by prompting the user to consent to the logging of their keystrokes. If the
user does not consent, the program exits If the user consents, the script defines an
“on_press™ function that takes an "event" parameter. This function is called every time a key
is pressed.

Inside the “en_press™ function, the current timestamp is obtained using the "datetine™
module, and the *event™ parameter is used to extract the name of the key that was pressed.
“This information is then appended to a log file in the format of “timestamp - key_name"

‘The *keyboard.on_press™ method is used to register the “on_press™ function as a callback
that s called every time a key is pressed. Finally, the script uses the "keyboard.wait™ method
to wait indefinitely for a key press, keeping the program running until the user terminates it
manually.

It's worth noting that keylogging can be a controversial topic and may raise privacy
concerns. While the script claims to be for “legitimate purposes only”, it's important to use

keylogging responsibly and only in situations where it is absolutely necessary and legal to
do so.
