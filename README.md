# Keylogger
keyloggers (Non-malicious ) are those that are used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employee activity in the workplace, parental control, or forensic investigations. In these cases, the user of the keylogger must obtain consent from the people being monitored, and use the tool in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.
A keylogger is a type of software or hardware tool that records every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device, including passwords, usernames, emails, chat messages, and other sensitive information. Keyloggers are often used by hackers or malicious actors to steal personal or confidential information from unsuspecting users.
For example, a company might use keyloggers to monitor the activity of its employees to ensure they are using company resources appropriately and not engaging in any illegal or unauthorized activities. Similarly, parents might use keyloggers to monitor their children's internet activity to protect them from online threats or inappropriate content.

Non-malicious keyloggers can also be used by law enforcement or forensic investigators to collect evidence in criminal investigations. In such cases, the use of keyloggers is typically authorized by a court order, and must be carried out in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.

Overall, the use of non-malicious keyloggers can be justified in certain situations, but it's important to obtain consent and use the tool in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.
